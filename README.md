# mrutools

Desktop Linux MRU Forensic Tool

MRUTools is a plugin based tool for desktop linux (kde, gnome, ...).

Each plugin extracts MRU information from certain applications or desktops.

The application is yet on (early) active development. Some of the future features will be:

- Several output formats (pdf, txt, csv, xml, etc).
- Timeline charts, even plaso compatibility.
- Plugins, plugins for everything!

If you think the idea worth it, write a plugin or new feature and pull request!
